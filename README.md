This is a repository about Eskom load shedding and economy data analysis. 
I used mostly Microsoft Excel and python, via Azure Data Studio for anaylsis. I used Notion to plan my project and to summarise the readings I've done to better understand load shedding and inflation. 
I used ChatGPT to assist me with loading Pandas, Seaborn and to construct my tables.
I tweaked the code where I needed to. 
I am still a beginner on python and ChatGPT has been of great assisstance
Still a work in progress
